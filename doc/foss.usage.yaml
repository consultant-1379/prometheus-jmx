    # Explain how the FOSS is used (Max 1000 characters)
    usage: |
      This FOSS evaluation concerns the free open software called JMX Exporter.
      JMX to Prometheus exporter: a collector that can configurably scrape and expose mBeans of a JMX target.
      This exporter is intended to be run as a Java Agent, exposing a HTTP server and serving metrics of the local JVM.
      It can be also run as an independent HTTP server and scrape remote JMX targets, but this has various disadvantages,
      such as being harder to configure and being unable to expose process metrics (e.g., memory and CPU usage).
      Running the exporter as a Java Agent is thus strongly encouraged.
